<div> 

## What is LIGO? 
LIGO is a statically typed high-level smart-contract language that compiles down to Michelson. It seeks to be easy to use and safe.

## Why LIGO? 
### Advantages
As mentioned above LIGO is a statically type high-level language. This mean LIGO is advantageous in the following areas:

* Better performance
* Code Completion
* Error reduction

### Supported Syntax's
LIGO also supports several high level syntax's that all use LIGO's well tested compiler to generate their Michelson counterparts. 

* OCamLIGO (*OCamL*)
* PascaLIGO (*Pascal*)
* ReasonLIGO (*ReasonML*) (__*In Progress*__)
