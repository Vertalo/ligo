Writing code is fun as long as it doesn't get out of hand. To make sure our code doesn't turn into spaghetti we can group some logic into functions.

## Instruction blocks

With `block`(s) you can wrap *instructions* and *expressions* into an isolated scope.
Each `block` needs to include at least one `instruction`, or a *placeholder* instruction called `skip`.

```pascaligo
// shorthand syntax
block { skip }
// verbose syntax
begin
    skip
end
```

## Defining a function

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Pascaligo-->

Functions in PascaLIGO are defined using the `function` keyword followed by their `name`, `parameters` and `return` type definitions.

Here's how you define a basic function that accepts two `ints` and returns a single `int`:


```pascaligo
function add(const a: int; const b: int): int is
    block { skip } with a + b
```

The function body consists of two parts:

- `block {<code>}` - logic of the function
- `with <value>` - the return value of the function

> ðŸ’¡ `skip` can be used as a placeholder for empty function blocks, when all the neccessary logic fits into `with` at the end. It is also possible to omit `block { skip } with`
in the above example, leaving only `a + b`.


<!--Cameligo-->

Functions in CameLIGO are defined using the `let` keyword, like value bindings.
The difference is that after the value name a list of function parameters is provided,
along with a return type.

Here's how you define a basic function that accepts two `ints` and returns an `int` as well:

```cameligo
let add (a: int) (b: int) : int = a + b
```

The function body is a series of expressions, which are evaluated to give the return
value.
